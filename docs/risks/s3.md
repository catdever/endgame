# S3 Buckets

## Steps to Reproduce

## Example

## Exploitation

## Remediation

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Note**: At the time of this writing, AWS Access Analyzer does **NOT** support auditing of this resource type to prevent resource exposure. **We kindly suggest to the AWS Team that they support all resources that can be attacked using this tool**. üòä

* **Trusted Accounts Only**: Ensure that  S3 Buckets are only shared with trusted accounts, and that the trusted accounts truly need access to the S3 Bucket.
* **Ensure access is necessary**: For any trusted accounts that do have access, ensure that the access is absolutely necessary.
* **Restrict access to IAM permissions that could lead to exposure of your S3 Buckets**: Tightly control access to the following IAM actions:
  - [s3:GetBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketPolicy.html): _Grants permission to return the policy of the specified bucket. This includes information on which AWS accounts and principals have access to the bucket._
  - [s3:ListAllMyBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html): _Grants permission to list all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request_
  - [s3:PutBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketPolicy.html): _Grants permission to add or replace a bucket policy on a bucket._

Also, consider using [Cloudsplaining](https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaining/#cloudsplaining) to identify violations of least privilege in IAM policies. This can help limit the IAM principals that have access to the actions that could perform Resource Exposure activities. See the example report [here](https://opensource.salesforce.com/cloudsplaining/)
